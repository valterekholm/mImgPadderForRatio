# mImgPadderForRatio


Swing app for adding borders to images in same folder, using Maven

A Java desktop app that adds padding to images to cut their ratio inside a chosen ratio.

This program is made with Swing. It has a purpose of making pictures more square-like. It offers a GUI, where users can set a ratio (x:y), choose if images should be overwritten, or new images be made, and...

if the given ratio should be applied in one or two axis.

(This means that in the first case, the ratio 4:7 - a standing "image-profile", program will only stipulate that images thinner than that be padded, but in the second case - both axis - pictures being wider than 7:4 will also be deemed excessive)

Anyway, if you got ways too make the code look better, or increase speed, you can "connect" (or what it's called).

The need for this program came with the use of a webshop that used to crop tall images (visually - not in bytes).
